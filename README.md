### Hi, i'm David! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a software engineer as well as a 3rd-year Computer Science student at UC Irvine.**

I am currently a student who loves learning about computer science, more specifically AI and machine learning, but I am also interested in web development as well. I have a passion towards learning new things so I am open to learning more about all areas of computer science!

If you want to get in touch, you can find me at my [email](mailto:david.xiu@gmail.com)!
